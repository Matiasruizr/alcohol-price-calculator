# Final price calculator for alcohol in Chile
This project is a simple hibrid app that calculates the final price of an alcoholic beverage in Chile. The app is based on the taxes and margins that are applied to the net price of the beverage.

Is destinated to be used by wholesalers, that buy the products fron the producers and sell them to the retailers, there is no need for the final consumer to use this app, the idea comes from a real life problem exposed by "Distribuidora los 3 spa" a company that sells alcoholic beverages in Santiago, Chile as a wholesaler to retailers.
